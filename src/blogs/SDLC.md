**Q1. What is the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?**

**A:** The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured approach to developing software. It's a process that outlines the stages involved in creating a software application, from initial planning to deployment and maintenance. It provides a framework to manage the complexity of software projects and helps ensure the development process is organized, efficient, and produces high-quality software.

**Q2. Why is the SDLC important?**

**A:** The SDLC is important for several reasons:

- **Structure & Organization:** It provides a structured approach to software development, making the process more predictable and manageable.
- **Improved Communication:** It facilitates better communication among team members and stakeholders.
- **Reduced Costs:** By planning carefully and catching errors early, the SDLC can reduce development costs and avoid costly rework later.
- **Increased Quality:** The SDLC encourages a focus on quality throughout the development process, resulting in more reliable and user-friendly software.
- **Risk Management:** It allows for identification and mitigation of potential risks early in the project.
- **Clear Expectations:** Defines clear objectives and deliverables.

**Q3. Name and briefly describe the common stages of the SDLC.**

**A:** The most common stages of the SDLC include:

- **Planning/Requirements Gathering:** Defining the project's goals, scope, and functional/non-functional requirements. This includes understanding the problem the software needs to solve.
- **Analysis:** Analyzing the gathered requirements to create a clear picture of what the software needs to do. This may involve creating diagrams, use cases, etc.
- **Design:** Creating the blueprint for the software, including architecture, database schema, user interfaces, and algorithms.
- **Implementation (Coding):** Writing the code to build the software according to the design.
- **Testing:** Testing the software to identify and fix bugs and ensure it meets requirements.
- **Deployment:** Making the software available to users.
- **Maintenance:** Providing ongoing support, updates, and bug fixes after the software has been deployed.

**SDLC Models**

**Q4. What are some common SDLC models?**

**A:** Some common SDLC models include:

- **Waterfall:** A linear, sequential model where each phase is completed before moving to the next. Good for well-defined projects but less flexible.
- **Agile:** An iterative and incremental approach with short development cycles (sprints) and focus on adaptability and customer feedback. Includes Scrum and Kanban.
- **Iterative:** A development cycle that is repeated until the end product is reached.
- **Spiral:** A risk-driven approach that emphasizes repeated testing and evaluation.
- **V-Model:** A testing-focused model with a verification and validation approach matching the developmental stages.

**Q5. What is the Waterfall model, and what are its limitations?**

**A:** The Waterfall model is a sequential SDLC model where each phase is completed before moving on to the next. Limitations include:

- **Inflexibility:** It's difficult to go back to earlier phases once they're completed.
- **Late Testing:** Testing often happens late in the process, making it more costly to fix issues.
- **Poor for Complex Projects:** Not suitable for complex projects with changing requirements.
- **Delayed Customer Feedback:** Feedback is usually not received until late in the process.

**Q6. What is Agile methodology? Briefly explain one specific agile model.**

**A:** Agile methodology emphasizes iterative development, flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It's a more flexible alternative to traditional, plan-driven methods. A specific agile model:

- **Scrum:** Scrum divides projects into short iterations called sprints (typically 2-4 weeks). Each sprint involves planning, implementation, review, and retrospective. The team has defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team) and conducts daily stand-up meetings to ensure progress. Scrum emphasizes adaptability and continuous improvement.

**Q7. What's the difference between the Waterfall and Agile methodologies?**

**A:** The primary differences are:

- **Approach:** Waterfall is linear and sequential, while Agile is iterative and incremental.
- **Flexibility:** Waterfall is rigid, while Agile is flexible and adaptable to change.
- **Customer Involvement:** Waterfall has limited customer involvement, while Agile emphasizes continuous customer feedback and collaboration.
- **Risk Handling:** Waterfall tackles risks later, while Agile addresses them early and often.

**Specific Stages**

**Q8. What is the purpose of requirements gathering/analysis phase?**

**A:** The purpose of the requirements gathering/analysis phase is to:

- **Understand Needs:** Identify and document the needs of the stakeholders and users.
- **Define Scope:** Clearly define the scope of the project and what's included.
- **Document Requirements:** Create detailed functional and non-functional requirements that guide development.
- **Clarify Ambiguities:** Resolve any unclear or conflicting requirements.
- **Establish a Foundation:** Set a solid foundation for the rest of the development process.

**Q9. What are the functional and non-functional requirements? Give example.**

**A:**

- **Functional Requirements:** Describe what the software should *do*. For example, a function to add items to shopping cart, or generate reports.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Describe how well the software should *perform*, such as performance, security, usability, and maintainability. For example, response time of API should not be more than 2 seconds, the website should be compatible with all major browsers, or data must be encrypted.

**Q10. What happens during the design phase?**

**A:** During the design phase, we:

- **Architectural Design:** Decide on the overall structure and components of the software.
- **Database Design:** Design the database schema for storing data.
- **User Interface (UI) Design:** Design how users will interact with the software.
- **Algorithm Design:** Choose or develop the algorithms for specific functions.
- **Technology Selection:** Decide on the technologies to be used.

**Q11. What is the purpose of the testing phase? What types of testing might be involved?**

**A:** The purpose of the testing phase is to:

- **Identify Bugs:** Find and fix software errors (bugs).
- **Verify Requirements:** Ensure the software meets the specified functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Improve Quality:** Enhance the reliability, performance, and usability of the software.

Types of testing include:

- **Unit Testing:** Testing individual components/functions.
- **Integration Testing:** Testing interactions between different components.
- **System Testing:** Testing the whole system to verify end-to-end functionalities.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Testing by end-users to ensure it meets their needs.
- **Performance Testing:** Testing how the software performs under load.

**Q12. What is deployment and what are some considerations for deploying software?**

**A:** Deployment is the process of making the software available to users. Considerations include:

- **Environment:** Setting up the server or cloud environment.
- **Configuration:** Configuring the software for the target environment.
- **Data Migration:** Migrating existing data if needed.
- **User Training:** Providing guidance for users.
- **Monitoring:** Implementing monitoring to track performance and identify issues.
- **Rollback Plans:** Having a plan to revert to previous versions in case of problems.

**Q13. What does 'maintenance' involve in the SDLC?**

**A:** Maintenance involves:

- **Bug Fixing:** Addressing any issues that are found after deployment.
- **Updates/Patches:** Releasing updates and security patches.
- **Enhancements:** Making improvements and adding new features.
- **Performance Tuning:** Optimizing software performance.
- **User Support:** Providing ongoing help to users.
